## It's Nicole!
Hi! I'm **Nicole Holloway**, but well, you could just call me "Nicole." I'm in college, I enjoy making (~~and suffering with~~) programs on my free time, especially in my favourite language of all time, **C++**.

_A lot of the stuff I work on falls on one of two categories:_
* Purposeful.
* Random.
You will see most of my projects fall on the latter, hah!

I currently maintain a few projects under my belt, including but not limited to:
* `playbook`, a message splitter and scripting language for multi-proxying with Discord bot Tupperbox
* `storybook`, a storytelling engine interfacing with a Discord bot for interactive stories
* `chocolite`, a SQLite-like database management system supporting multidimensional databases in containers
Some are inactive because I either lost motivation or don't know where to start/continue.

Others are in my head, waiting to be unleashed and sent to GitHub repositories.

Well, that's it from me. See you around! âœ¨\
\- With love, Nicole ðŸ«¶
